					I am a full stack web developer looking to build a more
					intuitive user experience on the web. I recently earned
					a certificate in full stack development from the
					University of Texas bootcamp, with newly developed
					skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web
					design. I am known as an innovative problem solver
					passionate about developing apps, with a focus on
					mobile-first design and development. With each project,
					my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful
					user experience.
